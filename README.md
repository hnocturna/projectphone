# projectphone

This is a learning project designed to help people find phones that fit their needs and requirements.

There are currently three options:

  1. Find a phone by interest - You know what you use your phone for, but you don't have specific requirements or don't know
  what kind of specifications that interest requires.
  
  Most useful for people who are not power users and just want a phone that suits their needs.
  
  2. Search phones - You already know what phone you're interested in, you just want to see its specifications in detail.
  
  3. Requirements - You have a specific list of requirements that you need in a phone. This option will help you find phones
  that meet your requirement.
  
  You can be as specific or as loose as you want here. Want only phones that are 8mm thin or less? You can do that.
  Want phones that are water resistant, under 5in screen size, utilizing AMOLED, has front facing speakers, a finger-print
  scanner, and has Snapdragon 801, 805, or 808, but not 810? You can do that too.
  
Currently, the UI needs a lot of work and there are no animations, but like I said, it's a learning project and as I learn,
more will be added to it.
